## 📘 Project Overview
This project presents a **comprehensive analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) data** using **Tableau**.  
The aim is to visualize adoption trends, manufacturer dominance, and clean energy compliance to support data-driven decision-making in the EV sector.

The dataset includes over **150,000 registered EVs across the United States**, offering insights into:
- Total EV registrations  
- Electric range and performance  
- Manufacturer and model popularity  
- State-wise distribution  
- Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility  

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- To visualize EV adoption trends across years and states.  
- To identify top EV manufacturers and models.  
- To analyze CAFV eligibility distribution.  
- To provide actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and manufacturers.

## 🗂️ Dataset Information
**Dataset:** Electric Vehicle Population Data  
**Source:** U.S. Government Open Data Repository  

**Key Attributes:**
- `Make` – Vehicle manufacturer (e.g., Tesla, Nissan)
- `Model` – Specific EV model
- `Model Year` – Year of registration
- `State` – U.S. state where vehicle is registered
- `Electric Range` – Distance (in miles) per full charge
- `CAFV Eligibility` – Indicates compliance with clean fuel standards
- `EV Type` – BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) / PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle)

## 🧩 Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Extracted from government open data sources.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Removed null values, duplicates, and standardized EV types.  
3. **Preprocessing:** Converted data types and created calculated fields (e.g., average range, EV type %).  
4. **Visualization:** Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard including:
   - KPI cards  
   - Line charts (year-wise adoption)  
   - Geographic maps (state-wise distribution)  
   - Bar charts (top makes and models)  
   - Donut charts (CAFV eligibility)  
   - Interactive filters (state, type, make, CAFV status)

## 📊 Results & Insights
- **Tesla** leads with over **68,000 registered EVs (52%)**.  
- **California** ranks highest with over **150,000 EVs**.  
- **BEVs (77.6%)** dominate over **PHEVs (22.4%)**.  
- Average **electric range: 67.83 miles**.  
- Only **41.8% of vehicles** qualify for CAFV benefits.
